# treehouse
The treehouse spontaneously generates imps, which are used to spawn your resources.

## minimap
UI element floating in the screen that shows the position of the current field of view and the location of any units and structures that are owned by that account or which can be seen. 

The terrain as well as the position of other elements of the world, resources and vegetables can be seen, albeit in smaller form.

Units and structures that have already been seen will remain, but those that are not currently under active vision become dark due to the Fog of War.
