The Treehouse allows the harvesting of resources and automatically creates daemons over time. Each Treehouse will only produce up to three daemons until one daemon is morphed into other Units. When the user has a Spawning Aqueduct, the Treehouse can be morphed into a Colony, with the final stage of evolution being the Academy.

The treehouse spontaneously generates units used to spawn your resources.

Nodes allow you control of additional CPU and GPU units.

Nodes provide granular unit control for your elastic cloud infrastructure.

As your computing units grow in number, you must spawn more nodes to control them.
