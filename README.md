The treehouse spawn unix daemons over time, daemons are morphed into other units. When the user has a spawning [aqueduct](https://github.com/nonsensews/aqueduct), the treehouse can be morphed into a [colony](https://github.com/nonsensews/colony), with the final stage of evolution being the [academy](https://github.com/nonsensews/academy).

Spawn more nodes from the treehouse to allow you control of additional processing units.

Nodes provide granular unit control for your elastic high-performance computing infrastructure.

Remember, as your computing units grow in number, you must spawn more nodes to control them.
