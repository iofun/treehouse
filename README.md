# spaceboard

The spaceboard is a distributed blackboard spawning LinuxÂ® daemons running inside [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) container instances and [Luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) processes over time that grow into other units; nodes provide granular unit control with in `exp` clusters.

## Community
