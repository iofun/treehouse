[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nonsensews/treehouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nonsensews/treehouse)

The forest spawn unix-like daemons over time, daemons are morphed into other units. When the user has an [aqueduct](https://github.com/nonsensews/aqueduct), the treehouse can be morphed into a [colony](https://github.com/nonsensews/colony), with late stage being two random papers in the [academy](https://github.com/nonsensews/academy).

Spawn more nodes from the treehouse to allow the network control of additional processing units.

Nodes provide granular unit control with in the elastic high-performance computing network infrastructure.

Remember, as your computing units grow in number, you must spawn more nodes to control them.
