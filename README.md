# treehouse
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nonsensews/treehouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nonsensews/treehouse)

The treehouse spawn unix-like daemons over time, daemons are morphed into other units. When the user has an spawning [aqueduct](https://github.com/nonsensews/aqueduct), the treehouse can be morphed into a [colony](https://github.com/nonsensews/colony), with the final stage of evolution being the [academy](https://github.com/nonsensews/academy).

Spawn more nodes to allow the network control of additional GPU and CPU processing units.

Nodes provide granular unit control with in this tropical high-performance computing network infrastructure.

Remember, as your processing units grow in number, you must spawn more nodes to control them.
