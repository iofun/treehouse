The treehouse creates unix daemons over time, daemons are morphed into other units. When the user has a spawning [aqueduct](https://github.com/nonsensews/aqueduct), the treehouse can be morphed into a [colony](https://github.com/nonsensews/colony), with the final stage of evolution being the [academy](https://github.com/nonsensews/academy).

Nodes allow you control of additional CPU and GPU units.

Nodes provide granular unit control for your elastic cloud infrastructure.

Remember, as your computing units grow in number, you must spawn more nodes to control them.
