The`spaceboard` is a distributed blackboard system spawning Linux® processes running inside a SIF ([Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) Image Format) and [Luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) over time that grow into other units; nodes provide granular unit control with in `spaceboard` clusters, spawn more nodes to allow control of additional units. 

Feel free to [explore](https://github.com/spacebeam) and remember; as your system grow in number, you must spawn more nodes to control it.
