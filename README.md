# spaceboard

The spaceboard is a distributed blackboard spawning LinuxÂ® processes running inside [Singularity](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity) container instances and [Luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) that over time grow into other units; nodes provide granular unit control with in `spaceboard` clusters. 

Feel free to [explore](https://github.com/spacebeam) and remember; spawn more nodes to allow control of additional units.
